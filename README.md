#INSwift

Some little extensions and code snippets for Apple's Swift language.

## Features

### nameOfClass
- Returns the name of a class as a String. This method is a counterpart for Objective-C's NSStringFromClass() written in swift and compatible with every class in swift (except for those with special characters like umlauts in the name).


## Examples

To see some examples in action just clone the repo and open the Playground files from the Example directory.


## Requirements

Xcode 6 + Swift


## Version

At the moment this is only a repository of code snippets not to loose them so no version released, yet!


## License

INSwift is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
